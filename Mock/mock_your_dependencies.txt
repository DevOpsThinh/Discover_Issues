"Why do most dev fear to make continuous changes to their code? They are afraid they'll break it!
Why are they afraid they'll break it? Because they don't have test." (- Robert C.Martin)

- MockK: https://github.com/mockk/mockk
(Mocking various types & behavior.)

- Mockito: https://site.mockito.org/
(Was very well defined & widely used lib to mock the dependencies.)

- Mockito-Kotlin: https://github.com/mockito/mockito-kotlin
(From Niek Haarman is very nicely written lib => is very much recommended
& very much loved by developer community.)

- Kluent (Fluent Assertion-Library for Kotlin): https://markusamshove.github.io/Kluent/Mocking.html
