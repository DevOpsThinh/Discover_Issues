Problem: Could not delete caches dir yourProject\build\kotlin\compileDebugTestingKotlin

Temporary solution:
Delete (the contents of) the folder which is giving you the issue. For example:

..\app\build\kotlin\compileDebugKotlin\caches-jvm\inputs
If you get: "The file is open in OpenJDK Platform Binary" you'll need to stop these processes through Windows Task Manager > Details > Java.exe.

Note: You can also delete your shared preferences by removing /data/data/
com.your.package.name/shared_prefs/your_prefs_name.xml and
your_prefs_name.bak and clearing the in-memory preferences with the
following code: context?.getSharedPreferences("prefs",
Context.MODE_PRIVATE)?.edit()?.clear()?.commit().
